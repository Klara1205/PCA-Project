PCA is a linear-algebra technique that transforms correlated features into a small set of uncorrelated principal components ordered by explained variance.  
We use PCA to (1) reduce dimensionality, (2) diagnose multicollinearity, (3) visualize highâ€‘dimensional data in 2D/3D.  

Sections:  
Application: Real-world use cases of PCA (e.g., genomics, imaging, finance, marketing)  
Mathematics: Derivation of PCA through covariance matrices, eigenvalues, and SVD  
Visualization: 2D plots on PC1/PC2, variance-explained scree charts, cluster structure
